Banker's Algorithm
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. This algorithm is used to prevent deadlocks in a system by determining if a state is safe or not.

Algorithm Overview
The Banker's Algorithm works by simulating the allocation of resources to each process and checking if the resulting state is safe or not. It does this by maintaining a matrix of the maximum resource needs of each process, a matrix of the resources currently allocated to each process, and a vector of the available resources.

The algorithm starts by finding a process that has not finished and whose maximum demand is less than or equal to the available resources. It then simulates allocating the required resources to the process and marks it as finished. It repeats this process until either all processes have finished or no processes can be allocated resources.

If all processes have finished, the system is in a safe state. If there are still unfinished processes and no processes can be allocated resources, the system is in an unsafe state and a deadlock has occurred.

Java Code
The Java code provided in this project implements the Banker's Algorithm. The code consists of a BankersAlgorithm class with a constructor and an isSafe method. The constructor takes in the maximum resource needs of each process, the resources currently allocated to each process, and the available resources. The isSafe method implements the Banker's Algorithm and returns a boolean value indicating whether the system is in a safe state or not.
